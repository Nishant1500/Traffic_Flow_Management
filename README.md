# Traffic Flow Management with AI

![image](https://github.com/Nishant1500/Traffic_Flow_Management/assets/53296643/ea54de61-2a49-4491-b02d-2b1cb47d5a6e)

## Overview

This repository contains the base code for a Traffic Flow Management system that utilizes artificial intelligence to detect vehicle density, calculate time durations for each lane, and control traffic lights using a microcontroller. The vehicle detection is performed on Google Colab, and the data is then transmitted to the microcontroller through websockets. This project, developed as a part of a school project, incorporates Supervision for vehicle counting in specific zones within each lane. Additionally, the system features a frontend built with Flowbite UI, JQuery, and Socket.io, hosted on `localhost:3000`. The project serves a Socket.io server on port `3000` for the frontend and a WebSocket server on port `4000` for communication with the microcontroller. The microcontroller uses Mike Causer's TM1637 driver to display relevant information on an LED display.

## Features

- **Vehicle Density Detection:** The system employs AI-based algorithms to detect and analyze vehicle density in each lane, with vehicle detection performed on Google Colab.

- **Zone-based Vehicle Counting:** Supervision is integrated to count the number of vehicles in specific zones within each lane, providing detailed information for traffic analysis.

- **Time Duration Calculation:** Based on real-time vehicle density data, the system calculates optimal time durations for traffic lights at each intersection.

- **Microcontroller Integration:** The traffic lights are controlled by a microcontroller, which receives the calculated time durations from the AI system through websockets and adjusts the traffic signal accordingly. The microcontroller uses Mike Causer's TM1637 driver to display relevant information on an LED display.

- **Frontend with Flowbite UI:** The user interface is built using Flowbite UI, JQuery, and Socket.io, accessible at `localhost:3000`.
